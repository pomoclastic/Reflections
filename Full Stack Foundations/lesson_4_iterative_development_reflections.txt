1.  There are several different ways to go about tackling a complex project.
    Compare and contrast some of the pro's and con's of a "top-down" approach
    focusing on the front-end first versus a "bottom-up" approach that focus on
    the database and server-side code first. Share your synthesis with your
    fellow classmates.

Reply:  I believe the pro's and con's will depend on context, what type of product
    one is trying to build, the programming languages used, and for whom the product
    is. Utilizing a "top-down" approach will give faster results for a client
    with time pressures & through the use of a language like JavaScript, for example,
    depending on needs, total functionality can be created from the front-end.
    However, a "bottom-up" approach can give greater functionality by the time the
    front-end is tackled, again, depending on the project. Also, a "bottom-up"
    approach will give one all the data one needs to configure first and then allow
    one to visualize how to best present the data to users. Security should always
    be a focus regardless of one's approach.

    Disclaimer: I have yet to have a great variety of experience and projects to
    give an answer which reflects such knowledge. This is mostly speculation
    based on what I've learned for the past 9 months.
